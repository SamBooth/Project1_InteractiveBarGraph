Short description
  This is a data visualization project using data from a corpus. This program creates a 3d interactive bar graph that compares when a 
  searched word was used. 
  
Inspiration
  I found this corpus http://corpus.byu.edu/now/ which allowed me to initially start thinking about using words in my data visualization. 
  When I searched online for data visualizations using a corpus, I couldn't find much other than programs that simply spat data back
  out at you once you gave it a certain word. I really like the 3D capabilities of ofxBullet, so that inspired me to try to do my 
  project in a 3D way that still allowed the user to gain more knowledge of the data than just from reading numbers off a screen.
  
Build Instructions
  This project uses both ofxBullet and ofxCSV. ofxCSV is used to search through the data, and ofxBullet is used to create the 3D bar graph
  environment. 
  
Usage Instructions
  Scrolling your mouse allows you to zoom in and out of the screen. Clicking and dragging the screen allows you to rotate around the 3D
  environment. Holding spacebar, then clicking on a cylinder allows you to only move the cylinder without moving the screen. Pressing 
  1,2,3,4, or 5 allows you to see the breakdown of each time a word was used in it's specific context. For instance, if you pressed
  1 for spoken, smaller cylinders would appear behind the blue spoken bar to tell you which news station spoke the word.
